# gym-viruskiller

This project represents a game with the purpose of eliminating viruses by shooting sanitizer at them. For this, there is a player, viruses that keep showing with random coordinates towards it, sanitizer ’bullets’ and a health bar, which indicates when the character dies (it becomes more red for each virus that passed the virus and was not shot). If the viruses are not killed, they will begin to move towards the player and, if enough of them reach him, the game ends, in other words, it caught the virus. If, otherwise, the player managed to elliminate enough viruses such that there aren’t any left and the health bar is still partially green, the game is won and a corresponding message is displayed.
After creating the environment, and the game is functional, the goal is to train the computer to play it, without receiving commands from the user. The algorithm is divided into steps, and when testing, a predefined number of steps is given. In order to have an optimal result, it would store the last coordinates of where the sanitizer was shot and the score was improved. At the end, the score is be displayed.
